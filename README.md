My first day at gndec was a delightful day ,it started with shabad kirtan at gurdwara Sahib in gndec campus.It was a perfect start.
The atmosphere of auditorium was very energetic,stage was beautifully decorated and it felt so good to sit among my new peers.  
After few minutes host invited Harpreet Mam ,her words were really helpful and guiding for us.  
Then our principal sir inspired us with his speech and it filled us with enthusiasm.  
Nest the AGDP officer shared invaluable insights on karma and delayed reward for good deeds.
That day I learned alot of lessons that will help me to grow in my journey.

I had opportunity to attend insightful lecture by priya darshni
